# Fractals
This repository contains C programs which draw fractals using the formulas for creating the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.

To best understand the Mandelbrot set I highly recommend reading over it's Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

Here are some images to get an idea for what can be created with the following programs:

This is just one example of a Julia set:

Then we have the classic Mandelbrot set:

I've also produced the cubic Mandelbrot set:

As well as the quartic Mandelbrot:

And the quintic Mandelbrot:
